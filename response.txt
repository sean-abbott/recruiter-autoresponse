Thanks so much for reaching out. I'm always interested in hearing about what new and exciting opportunities are out there. As a software engineer I'm sure you can imagine that I get a very high volume of recruiters reaching out to me on LinkedIn or other platforms. It is a wonderful position of privilege to be in and I'm thankful for it.

It does however mean that I don't have the time to hop on a call with everyone who reaches out. A lot of the time, incoming messages represent a very poor fit indeed.

I would love to continue the conversation, but before I do, I'd like to level set around the level of seniority and type of role that you're looking for. 

Can you send along the company name, a job description and, total compensation details for the role you're reaching out in reference to? 

While I very much appreciate the fact that exceptionally talented and engaged recruiters reach out consistently, sorting serious and high quality opportunities from spam would be a full time job without an autoresponder.

In the absence of detailed information regarding the nature of the opportunity in question, I will be unavailable for further discussion. Also, a number of recruiters use an email that is no longer associated with my professional life. I am only available for discussion at the address "sabbott.official" on the same email server as the deprecated one you may be using. 
Thanks again for reaching out!
 
I look forward to hearing from you.
