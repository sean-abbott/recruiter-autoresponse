Based on the Medium Article entitled - [Career Advice Nobody Gave Me: Never ignore a recruiter](https://index.medium.com/career-advice-nobody-gave-me-never-ignore-a-recruiter-4474eac9556) this repo has a copyable script which you can use to auto-respond to recruiters.

This is licensed under MIT so please feel free to fork and use as you'd like. 

If you like it, please consider leaving a github star.  I think that it would be super cool to see how many people this helps.
